## Dynamic Programming, Memoization, Slow method 0(n^2) 

Memoization T Up || 
Dynamic Programming B Up

Conclusion Memoization T Up is the better of the three.

Slow method is a great starting point as the iterations go one by one
as a worst case scenario, finally caching and a hash library `{}` 
will greatly reduce the processing time.
